	<br>The Lathe was originally made to produce new Cubees for the Stretch and Squash Cubee App (To Be Constructed).
	<br>Hence the container around the turned shape.
	<br>Bringing up the menu will allow you turn the container off using Free Size.

<div>
	<br>In the Stretch and Squash Cubee App you can set the stretch and squash range to
	<ul>
		<li>One Cubee as used in the Just Cubees App</li>
		<li>A Mini Cubee which is one quarter of a Cubee</li>
		<li>A Micro Cubee which is one sixtieth of a Cubee</li>
	</ul>
	<br>When the range is set to one Cubee shapes within the app can only be moved by one Cubee at a time.
	<br>The container gives an idea of the spacing that will occur between shapes.
	<br>Think of them as showing the margins for the shape.
