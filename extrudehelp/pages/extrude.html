	<br>Using Extrude.
</div>
<div>
	<br>The extrusion is controlled by using the square and circular markers.
	<br><img src="images/extrusion.jpg" width="75%">
	<br>The top marker on the axis line can only move on the axis.
	<br>The bottom marker on the axis line is fixed.
</div>
<div>
	<br>The cross section of the extrusion is controlled by the tool on the right.
	<br>The tool at the bottom controls further parameters along the length of the extrusion.
</div>
<div>
	<br><b>Cross Section Tool</b>
</div>
<div>
	<br>The square and circular markers control the shape of the cross section.
	<br>Making changes to the cross section that puts the centre white dot outside the cross section will produce 
	<br>strange results at the start and end of the extrusion and is best avoided.  
</div>
<div>
	<br>Further adjustments to the cross section can be made by adding new  markers.
	<br>Click anywhere on the outline of the cross section and a dialogue box opens, so you can do this.  
</div>
<div>
	<br><img src="images/dbox.jpg" width="15%">  
</div>
<div>
	<br>This dialogue box can also be used to straighten or curve sections and to delete them.  
</div>
<div>
	<br><b>Parameter Tool</b>
</div>
<div>
	<br><img src="images/variables.jpg" width="15%"> 
</div>
<div>
	<br>The scale, angle and position of the cross section can be changed along the length of the extrusion as it is extruded.
	<br>The values at any point are determined by the position of the parameter line at any point.
	<br>Switch between variables using the variable dialogue box.
	<br>Rotation is in the plane shown, ie about the z axis.
	<br>Tilt is rotating the top towards or away from you; ie about the x axis.
	<br>Twist is rotating towards the left or right; ie about the y axis.
</div>
<div>
	<br>Locking the scale or position always locks the scale or movement to the current x scale and x position.
</div>
<div>
	<br>Additional markers can be added to the parameter line and sections of the line 
	<br>can be straightened or curved by clicking on the line and using the dialogue box
	<br>drag the markers to adjust the line.
</div>
<div>
	<br><img src="images/pcurves.jpg" width="15%">
</div>
<div>
	<br>As each marker is selected its position along the line is labelled at the top and its value is labelled on the left.
	<br><img src="images/labels.jpg" width="80%"> 
	<br>A label for the maximum, minimum and middles values are also shown.
</div>
<div>
	<br>Clicking on a label brings up a dialogue box that allows you to change the values 
	<br>for that label and adjust the extrusion accordingley.
	<br>Note that scales are always kept between 0 and 1, with 1 being the size of cross section as constructed.
	<br>The maximum length of the extrusion is fixed.
