	<br>What is One?
</div>
<div>
	<br>In the very unlikely event of finding yourself in the Magical Domain of Numbers you will find that One is an extremely bright body of swirling, flowing lava that shimmers shades of luminescence ruby reds shot through with glimmering gold, orange and white. From a gash within the lava bright gold lava spills over the top and down the sides turning orange then crimson as it does before flowing to the bottom and back into the core. In this work, for brevity, it will be referred to unflatteringly as a red stone or even shorter as a red one. [For a description of the Domain of Numbers read 'A Deceit of Numbers']
