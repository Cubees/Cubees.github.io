	<br>When Solidity is ticked Cubees in the model will act as solid objects they will not pass through each other or the walls or the ground.
	<br>When Solidity is not ticked Cubees in the model pass through each other and the walls and the ground.

	<br>There is an issue when the cursor keys are held down and models are fast moving even with Solidity ticked they can pass into each other.
	<br>If this happens you may have to untick Solidity to free the model then re-tick Solidity.
	<br>Single presses on the keys avoids this issue.
