#Cubees

##Intentions

A simple 3D scene builder for use by children 

##Introduction and Definitions

A **Cubee** is a 3D object that fits into a unit cube.

Individual Cubees can be fitted together within a **Construction Site** to form **Models**.

Individual Models can be placed within a **Scene**.

###Just Cubees

This is the basic system and is the one being currently coded. Cubees are pre-defined and are the only building blocks available.

###Stretch and Squash Cubees.

Once the Just Cubees system is working a more customisable system is envisaged.

Cubees will be able to be manufactured in a **Factory** and will fit into a cuboid.

Length measurements will be in Cubees, Mini-Cubees (a quarter of a Cubee) and Micro-Cubees (One sixtieth of a Cubee).

In the Factory Cubees will be manufactured using a Lathe or an  Extrusion tool, or will be adjusted by stretching or squashing them in any of the X, Y and Z directions.
